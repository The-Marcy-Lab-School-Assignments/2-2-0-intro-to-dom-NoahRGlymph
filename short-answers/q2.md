What is the difference between an HTMLCollections and NodeLists? Are they arrays?

    HTMLCollections only use HMTL element types, while NodeLists returns all of the nodes. Only NodeLists can use the forEach array method.

Although you did a good job explaining the difference between HTMLCollections and NodeLists you didn't mention whether they are arrays or not
